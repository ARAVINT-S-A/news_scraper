# Notes

## Sitemaps

The sitemaps are usually available in `robots.txt`. If not, you should try to [Google](google.com), [Perplexity](perplexity.ai) for keywords like `"ndtvprofit.com daily sitemap index xml"`. This method helped in retrieving a few sitemap index that are were available otherwise.

- https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/81896735.cms - Redirect not showing in head, No sitemap as well.
- https://www.indiainfoline.com/news/top-share-market-news/page/14072 - New articles have no ID in the url. Seems to allow [old articles](https://www.indiainfoline.com/article/x/x-122110400370_1.html) to redirect
- https://in.investing.com/news/a/a-4293269 - Doesn't redirect to actual url
